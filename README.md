# React-Kanban-Board
Kanban Board using React.

Kanban is a visual project management methodology which focuses on visualising work processes, optimising workflows, and improving efficiency.
Each column represents a different stage in the workflow, and cards represent individual tasks or work items. As work progresses, cards are moved from one column to the next, reflecting the flow of work through the process.

Within this project, you have the ability to perform the following actions:

Create and delete cards.
Seamlessly drag and drop cards between columns.
Observe a visual indicator: when the number of cards within a column exceeds a certain threshold, the count turns red, alerting you to potential workflow congestion.
